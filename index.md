### CPSC 120 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorites lab because it taught me how blackjack is played. With this information I will go to La vegas with only a crisp 100 dollar bill and leave with 10,000. It was cool how the game worked in code. It was a long lab and learned very much from it.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 is another favorite the main reason is because of the std::string. While working on the lab 2 I understood how the std::string worked and the lab was interesting in expaining the std::string. This was a great lab my partner also worked hard and we were able to finish on time.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part-2 This lab was good because I didn't really understand it but my parthner was able to teach me and help me understand how to write loops. At the end I was able to finish the lab and be able to write a else loop calling a function. Seeing how complicated part-2 was really eye opening I had to really lock in and finish on time.
